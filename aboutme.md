title: About me

---
# Graduate Student at the University of Washington
My roots are grounded in Los Angeles, California, where my starting point in marine science started as a volunteer at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Informing all ages about the fascinating aspects of marine life ignited a newfound passion; I knew I wanted a career connecting with others. As a first generation, Hispanic woman, I set off to pursue a bachelor’s in Marine Science at California State University, Monterey Bay. 6 hours away from home, I worked to learn, grow, and build my own path in science. I hit the road again and found myself in Seattle, Washington pursuing a Masters degree. Reflecting on my journey, I am intrigued to see what I embark on next, how I will continue to connect with others, and build my own identity between science and society. Stay tuned! 

When I’m not in the office doing research, you can find me at the gym, baking, or watching a documentary during the weekdays. My hobbies that take up my free time on the weekends include going to concerts, crafting, thrifting, and exploring nature. I have made it my personal goal to learn and discover the cities I live in and share the reasons I call them home away from home!
