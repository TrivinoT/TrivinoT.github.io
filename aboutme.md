title: About me
subtitle: Graduate Student at the University of Washington
---

I’m a third year graduate student pursuing a Masters degree at the University of Washington (UW) in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. My current research focuses on the human dimensions of MPA management in California. Using survey data, I aim to understand, connect, and inform policy regarding social aspects of marine resource management. My intentions are to pursue a career at the intersection of science and policy.
